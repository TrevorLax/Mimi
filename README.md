# Mimi - Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework

Mimi is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package that provides a component model for [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling), as described in detail on the [Mimi Framework Homepage](https://www.mimiframework.org). The [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/) includes information on the installation and use of this package, as well as details on the Mimi registry and step-by-step tutorials which users of different experience levels, starting with first-time users.
