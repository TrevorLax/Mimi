# Mimi - Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework

A [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling). For more information, see the **[Documentation](http://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/Mimi.jl/latest/)**.

Please get in touch with [David Anthoff](http://www.david-anthoff.com) if you are interested in using this framework or want to be involved in any way with this effort.

## Overview

Mimi is a package that provides a component model for integrated assessment models.

Also see the [OptiMimi](http://github.com/jrising/OptiMimi.jl) package for optimizing parameters within Mimi models.

Porting to [Mimi 0.5.0](https://github.com/anthofflab/Mimi.jl/releases/tag/v0.5.1):  If you are adapting models to the[Mimi 0.5.0](https://github.com/anthofflab/Mimi.jl/releases/tag/v0.5.1) breaking release or later, please use the [Integration Guide](http://anthofflab.berkeley.edu/Mimi.jl/latest/integrationguide.html) as guide to help port your models as easily as possible.

[Julia 1.0](https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero): Mimi has not yet been ported to Julia 1.0, and thus is not compatible with Julia 1.0 (or [Julia v0.7](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.7.0/NEWS/) which provides deprecation warnings for Julia 1.0).  The next release of Mimi will provide this compatibility.

## Installation

Mimi is an installable package. To install Mimi, use the following:

````
Pkg.add("Mimi")
````
